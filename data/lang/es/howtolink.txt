LINKING FOR DUMMIES (I)

Move your cursor over the machine (levitator, conveyor
belt or moving block) you want to link and press ENTER.

If you want the machine to be turned ON when some 
button or switch is ON and OFF when not, just write 
the number of that button and press ENTER again.

If you want the machine to be turned OFF when the 
button or switch is ON and ON when it is OFF, just 
write "not" and then the number. Then press ENTER.

Press ESCAPE to cancel all changes and go back to the 
editor.

If you want to unlink a machine, use BACKSPACE to 
delete the complete line.
