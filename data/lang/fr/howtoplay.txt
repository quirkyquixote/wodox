Your objective in each level is to reach the WARP POINT
(that looks like a fountain of light) with the WODOX.

The WODOX may perform a limited set of actions:
  * Use the ARROW KEYS to move the wodox.
  * Use SPACE to pick up or release a blob.

In addition to this, you may exert a limited control on
the level itself:
  * Press P to pause the level.
  * Press BACKSPACE to undo up to ten moves.
  * Press R (or "restart" below) to restart the level.
  * Press S (or "skip" below) to skip a level.
  * Press C (or "cheat" below) to load a solution. (1)
  * Press ESCAPE (or "give up" below) to quit.
