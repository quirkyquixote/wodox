ADVANCED LINKING (I)

If you have two TRIGGERS A and B the output of a 
given circuit is as follows (1 is ON and 0 is OFF):

   A   B   A or B   A and B   A xor B
  ------------------------------------
   0   0     0         0         0 
   0   1     1         0         1
   1   0     1         0         1
   1   1     1         1         0

If you write "not" before anything, the output is the
opposite of the input.

Use parenthesis to group as desired "(A or B) and C"
is not the same as "A or (B and C)". The first
calculates "X : A or B" and then "X and C", the second 
calculates "X : B and C" and then "A or X".
